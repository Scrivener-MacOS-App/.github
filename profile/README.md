## What is Scrivener for Mac?

Scrivener for Mac is a powerful content-generation tool for writers of all kinds. It allows you to compose and structure long and difficult documents, from novels and research papers to scripts and dissertations. Unlike standard word processors, Scrivener provides a management system for documents, notes, and metadata, all accessible from a single workspace.

The application includes a range of features such as a virtual corkboard for index cards, an outliner for structured planning, and a full-screen mode to help you focus on writing without distractions. You can also import and organize research materials—PDFs, web pages, images, and more—directly into your project for easy reference.

Scrivener is designed to handle large and complex writing projects with ease. Whether you're drafting a book, organizing a thesis, or writing a screenplay, Scrivener offers the tools you need to plan, write, and revise efficiently. It supports both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs and runs smoothly on macOS Sonoma, Ventura, and earlier versions.
